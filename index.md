# InnerShell Labs

Independent security research focused on security engineering, adversary analysis,
and the study of complex systems at scale.

This site documents work and learning across areas such as:
- Authentication and authorization failures
- Trust boundaries in distributed architectures
- Business logic abuse and adversarial behavior
- Detection, risk, and security feedback loops

From time to time, I also share learning progress, technical insights, and informed opinions
derived from hands-on experience and ongoing research.
