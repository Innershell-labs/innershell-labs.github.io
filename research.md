# Research

This page tracks ongoing and future research directions for **InnerShell Labs**.

## Current Focus Areas

### Authentication & Authorization Failures
Security breakdowns caused by trust boundary mistakes, identity propagation, and authorization design flaws at scale.

### Trust Boundaries in Distributed Systems
How complex service interactions, asynchronous workflows, and partial failures create non-obvious security risks.

### Business Logic Abuse Patterns
Attack narratives that exploit valid behavior, state inconsistencies, and workflow edge cases rather than traditional vulnerabilities.

### Detection, Risk, and Feedback Loops
Designing signals, metrics, and repeatable validation processes to reduce risk over time.

## Research Notes

Over time, deeper write-ups and structured notes will be published here and linked to supporting blog posts.
